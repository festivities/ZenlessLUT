## Usage with PixelsWorld

1. Download the game's internal LUT file [here]. *Take note that this is not a traditional LUT - it's hard to explain but you can't use it as if it was any other LUT for filmography.*

2. Drop the `ZenlessLUT.lua` file into the same directory as your `.aep` project file.

3. Import your LUT file into the same composition you are going to use it on. Once you load the `Lua load local code` preset in PixelsWorld and replace `MyCode.lua` with `ZenlessLUT.lua`, head onto the first `Layer` parameter and set it to the imported LUT. Control the strength of the LUT with the first `Slider` parameter.

4. If you have issues with flickering visuals/crashing, try turning off Multi-Frame Rendering in Edit -> Preferences -> Memory & Performance.
